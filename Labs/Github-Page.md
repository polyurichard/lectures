# Exercise: GitHub Page

A Github page is a static website hosted on Github. In this lab, you will create a Github page for yourself. You can use this page to introduce yourself to the world. 

1. Create a new repository in your Github Account .
2. Inside your repository, create a new page "index.md" in the root folder of your `main` branch. Give an introduction about yourself. Commit th changes.

3. Setup the Github page under the `Settings` tab. 
   <img src="image.png" alt="Alt text" width="600" />
4. Whenever there are changes in the `main` branch, the Github page will be updated automatically. Github actions will be triggered to build and deploy the page. You can see the status of the Github actions under the `Actions` tab.
   <img src="image-3.png" alt="Alt text" width="600" />
   <img src="image-4.png" alt="Alt text" width="600" />
5. After the Github action is completed, you can see the Github page under the `Deployments` tab under the `Actions` tab. 
   - Click on the link to see the Github page. 
   - Your URL should be in the form of `https://<organization-name>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/index.html`
   - *Remark*: Your `index.md` will be converted to `index.html` by Github actions when it is deployed.

```
[Github Page](https://github.com/[your Github ID])
<img src="[your_image_filename].jpg" alt="An image" width="600" />
